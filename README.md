Build a Docker image for your website.

First I created Github Repository,add README file.Then push my project code in github.After that i created my EC2 instance in Academic lab.
Connected my EC2 instance install Apache,docker and build a docker image.
Add Docker file and .yml file in github.
Add Secrets as well.
In starting faced some problem in building docker file then again make some changes in it and after that it worked fine.
